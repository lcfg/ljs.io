## Current Projects ##

* [Chromium][0] - I am a contributor to the [chromium][1] (and relatedly [blink][2]) projects.
* [Algorithms][3] - I am very interested in algorithms, this is where I am going to put stuff related to this subject once I get the time to do so :)

## Past Projects ##

* Contributing to the [Go programming language][p0] - fixed issues [667][go667], [1324][go1324],
  and [1606][go1606].
* [Weak][p1], an open source chess [perft][p2] calculator. This was intended to be a full-blown
  chess engine, but in the process of working on it I realised I simply wasn't passionate
  enough about the game to dedicate the time that would require. Regardless, it was great
  experience and taught me a lot about programming high performance software in C.
* Taking the [Algo 1][p3] course and writing up [notes][p4].
* Taking the inaugural [AI course][p5] and writing up [notes][p6].
* A &lsquo;rainbow' sorting visualisation, I've uploaded a version on the website <a
  href="/projects/rainbow" target="_self">here<a/>, the code is up on [github][p7].
* A small [AU][ref1] [template][p8] compatible with XCode 4.6.3 and OS.X 10.8 adapted from
  Fred Ghilini's [excellent tutorial][ref2].
