# Projects #

## Current ##

* I am a [contributor][0] to the [chromium][1] (and relatedly [blink][2]) projects.
* My latest [algorithmic][3] project is [algoholic][4], a collection of algorithms implemented in
  different languages.
* I am studying [xv6][5], a rather amazing toy OS codebase combined with high quality study
  material (in particular, the [xv6 book][6]) - Check out my [blog post][7] for more details.

## Past ##

* Contributed to the [Go programming language][p0] - fixed issues [667][go667], [1324][go1324],
  and [1606][go1606].
* Wrote [Weak][p1], an open source chess [perft][p2] calculator. This was intended to be a full-blown
  chess engine, but in the process of working on it I realised I simply wasn't passionate
  enough about the game to dedicate the time that would require. Regardless, it was great
  experience and taught me a lot about programming high performance software in C.
* Took the [Algo 1][p3] course and wrote up some [notes][p4].
* Took the inaugural [AI course][p5] and wrote up some [notes][p6].
* Created a &lsquo;rainbow' sorting visualisation and uploaded <a href="/projects/rainbow"
  target="_self">a version</a> on this website. The code is up on [github][p7].
* Wrote a small [AU][ref1] [template][p8] compatible with XCode 4.6.3 and OS.X 10.8 adapted
  from Fred Ghilini's [excellent tutorial][ref2].
