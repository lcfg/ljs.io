## Current Projects ##

* [OpenRig][0] is a nascent open-source guitar amp and effects simulator I have just started
  working on.
* I am very interested in algorithms; my [algorithms][1] page contains stuff I'm working on in
  relation to this.

## Past Projects ##

* Contributing to the [Go programming language][p0] - fixed issues [667][go667], [1324][go1324],
  and [1606][go1606].
* [Weak][p1], an open source chess [perft][p2] calculator. This was intended to be a full-blown
  chess engine, but in the process of working on it I realised I simply wasn't passionate
  enough about the game to dedicate the time that would require. Regardless, it was great
  experience and taught me a lot about programming high performance software in C.
* Taking the [Algo 1][p3] course and writing up [notes][p4].
* Taking the inaugural [AI course][p5] and writing up [notes][p6].
* A &lsquo;rainbow' sorting visualisation, I've uploaded a version on the website <a
  href="/projects/rainbow" target="_self">here<a/>, the code is up on [github][p7].
