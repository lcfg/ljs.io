# Hi #

This is [my][0] personal site. I contribute to the [chromium][1] open source project, study [algorithms][2] and work on other [projects][3]. Sometimes I [blog][4].

Professionally I work as a software engineer at [resin.io][5], focused mainly on frontend
development (however I've touched every layer of the full stack in typical startup style :)
