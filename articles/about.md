I'm Lorenzo [J.] Stoakes, a 32-year-old English bloke. I work at a [startup][0] as a
programmer, and like to... [program][1] on the side (particularly contributing to
[chromium][chr].)

I am also passionate about flying (I hope to get a license one day), music (I sometimes play
around with production and also play guitar), and beer (I hope to homebrew at some point :)

Contact me at <lstoakes@gmail.com>.
